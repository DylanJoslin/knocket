                <p>The videos in this collection were created as part of an Aboriginal Awareness course offered through NAIT, and they explore the immense wisdom, experiences, and history of Aboriginal peoples. The wisdom of the Elders expressed in these beautiful videos is invaluable, and for that reason they have now been made more widely available.</p>
